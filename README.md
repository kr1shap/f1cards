# 🏎️ PitCard

Everyone around me is a F1 **𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒌** and I have no idea why.

This is a simple, sleek, animated React app that showcases F1 drivers using interactive ID cards.
Built as a small project to get more used to TypeScript, and forming clean UI.

Fetches data from OpenF1 API, displaying it in a stylized, interactive ID card format. 

Built using __React+Vite+TS, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion & Axios__.
